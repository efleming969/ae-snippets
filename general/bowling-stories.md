# ACME Bowling Platform

We believe that an online platform, dedicated to bowling, where players can keep track of their game history, get statistics and build a community with other bowlers will result in increased sales of ACME products. We will know it is successful when there is a measurable increase in sales within 4 months of the first release

## Game Tracking

If bowlers had a variety of statistical views about their games, they could use that information to identify trends and potential improvements.  This should keep them engaged and visiting frequently.

(e.q. Game Avg, # of strikes/game, # of spares/game) 

## Advertising Campaigns

In order to drive new sales of ACME products, we want the capability to place ads that allow us to target new and existing customers

## Gear Impact Statistics

Users could measure the impact of certain gear on their game, if we provide detailed statistics related to the equipment they use

## Tips and Tricks

In order to discover new strategies and equipment for improving their game, users should be able to find and share tips and tricks among their peers, in the platform

## Lane Reservations

Bowlers could use the platform to reserve a lane at a bowling alley

## Virtual Leaderboard

In order to keep users on the platform, we could provide a “virtual leaderboard” system where bowlers can compete with other bowlers on various aspects of their game
